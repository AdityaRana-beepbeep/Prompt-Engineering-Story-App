# üìñ AI Story Generator Desktop Application

## ‚ú® Overview

This project is a desktop application that generates creative stories using Google's powerful Gemini API. It's designed to showcase and allow experimentation with different **Prompt Engineering** techniques: Zero-shot, Few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting.

A key new feature is the integration of **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**, enabling the application to read the generated stories aloud, enhancing accessibility and providing a more immersive user experience.

## üöÄ Features

* **Zero-shot Prompting:** Generate stories directly from a simple topic or prompt, relying solely on the model's pre-trained knowledge.
* **Few-shot Prompting:** Guide the AI with a few examples of input-output pairs to steer the story generation towards a desired style, tone, or structure.
* **Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT):** Encourage the AI to "think step-by-step" by breaking down the complex task of story creation into smaller, logical reasoning steps, often leading to more coherent and detailed narratives.
* **Voice Recitation (TTS):** Listen to your generated stories aloud with integrated Text-to-Speech functionality.
* **User-Friendly GUI:** An intuitive graphical interface built with Tkinter for easy interaction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x:** The core programming language for the application logic.
* **Tkinter:** Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit, used for building the desktop application's interface.
* **Requests:** A popular Python library for making HTTP requests to external APIs.
* **pyttsx3:** A cross-platform Python library for Text-to-Speech conversion, utilizing the speech synthesis engines available on the operating system.
* **Google Gemini API (Generative Language API):** The powerful Large Language Model (LLM) API from Google that generates the story content.
